# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains the following files:

- `run_analysis.R` script applies transformations on raw data and outputs a submission file for the assignment. It assumes you have the `UCI HAR Dataset` folder in your working directory. This folder is obtained from the .zip file in the assignment instructions.
- `CodeBook.Rmd` describes the raw data, the script, transformations, and output file.
- `activity_subject_means.txt` is the output file for submission.
